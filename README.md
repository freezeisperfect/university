`/Interpolation project` - contains project which approximates discrete data with qubic spline / lagrange interpolatns.

`/Izhikevich model` - contains project of modelling Impulse Neuron Network. Methods solve ODE with Euler's method, backward Euler's method and Runge-Kutta's method (4th order).

`/Queue model` - contains project of modelling real-time queue. While coming to cash register, customer decides to stand in queue which has less people. Model is counting mean of waiting time for each queue and some other parameters.
